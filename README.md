# How to solve problems on Leetcode to prepare for technical interviews

The single most important aspect of preparing for technical interviews is to solve many coding challenges.

1. Create yourself a progress sheet that includes things like what problem you’ve solved and how many minutes you allocated for that problem.

2.  If the total number of problems measures quantity, solve *a minimum of 40 problems*. If the total number of hours measures quality, *spend 20 hours*.

    ## The strategy

    - Go to a quiet location.
    - Pick a question.
    - Set a timer for 25 minutes.
    - Allocate the first 5 minutes to understand the problem and ask/answer clarifying questions to yourself.
    - Spend the next 20 minutes solving the problem on paper & pen/pencil (until timer rings).
    - Spend the next 10 minutes studying the solution.
    - Stop. Even if you’re in the middle of something important like trying to understand the solution. Do not spend more than 30–35 minutes per question.
    - Record activity on your progress chart.
    - Revisit the question next week.
